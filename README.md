A step by step guide in hopes of making installation as clear and easy as possible    
Primaraly for Windows users   
This guide goes over how to set up [PI-Pwn](https://github.com/stooged/PI-Pwn?tab=readme-ov-file#pi-pwn)  
I will cover the setup for only Raspberry Pi devices    
# Installing Raspberry Pi OS    
Download and install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

Set them as anything you want just remember them for later  
**Configure wireless LAN**  
Let the Pi connect to your home Wi-Fi  
Pi Model Dependant!!!

This will let you -   
1. Connect to your Pi via SSH.  
2. Forward an internet connection to your PS4 removing the need to unplug ethernet and change console internet settings.  
3. Update the script, payloads and etc.  
Tick  
Set locale settings  
It should auto to your correct region and kb layout if not set it manually     
  
**If your pi has no wireless capabilities you will have to use a second display for the instalation part of the script setup after that it will run automatically**  
    
**Services**  
![-](imgs/SSH.JPG)  
Tick    
Enable SSH  
Then choose

Then wait while the Pi OS is written to the SD Card  
Some drive error windows may show up press on 'Cancel' and 'OK' for any of them  
![-](imgs/Dun.JPG)  
Once the procces is finished some drive error windows may show up press on 'Cancel' and 'OK' for any of them you can then eject the SD Card and plug it into your Pi  
Power on your Pi and wait a few minutes for initial setup to auto complete(progress can be viewed over HDMI)    
# SSH into the Pi  
Not applicable if your Pi has no Wi-Fi Continue over HDMI   
**How to SSH into the Pi** 
# Download and install  
[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

# Installing the PI-pwn script by [stooged](https://github.com/stooged/PI-Pwn)  
One by one copy and run these commands (paste into ssh termianl with right click) 
```
sudo apt update
```  
```
sudo apt install git -y 
```  
```
sudo rm -f -r PI-Pwn
```    
```
git clone https://github.com/stooged/PI-Pwn
```  
```
cd PI-Pwn
```  
```
sudo cp -r PPPwn /boot/firmware/
```  
```
cd /boot/firmware/PPPwn
```  
```
sudo chmod 777 *
```  
```
sudo bash install.sh
```  
The Terminal will then ask you some setup questions  
  

  
1. Do you want the console to connect to the internet after PPPwn?  
Only for compatible Pi's which are connected to your home Wi-Fi network  
Chosing **Y** for this option means you will not be turning off the pi after a succsfull pwn run otherwise choose **N** 
![-](imgs/Q1.JPG)     
2. Do you want the Pi to shutdown after pwn success    
Choose yes if you do not want to connect the PS4 to the internet using a Wi-Fi compatible Pi
Are you using a usb to ethernet adapter for the console connection  
If you are using a Pi with no ethernet port choose **Y** if not then **N**
![-](imgs/Q2.JPG)  
3. Are you using a usb to ethernet adapter    
For Pi's with no ethernet port choose **Y** or **N** if you are using ethernet 
![-](imgs/Q3.JPG)  
4. Do you want to use the old python version of pppwn, It is much slower  
Choose **N** :/  
![-](imgs/Q4.JPG)   
5. Would you like to change the firmware version being used, the default is 11.00  
The only other compaible firmware at the time of writing is 9.00 so choose **Y** and type in 9.00 if that is the firmware you are using or simply choose **N** if you are on 11.00

6.Would you like to change the pi lan interface, the default is eth0    
For Pi's with ethernet choose **N**

The Pi will then reboot
